### Projects
Two Minute Papers is a YouTube channel I've followed for quite some time. In 2018 I saw one of his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIM24JDE3A) reviewing Stanford ML Group's submission to RSNA's Pneumonia ML challenge. This inspired me to try to code a ML solution to RSNA's challenge. This was tricker than I expected and I quickly got bogged down in simply working with the DICOM files and database structure provided. This experience helped me learn about data science. I was eventually able to run a simple ML script for processing the images, but my focus of the project had gone into managing the data base provided.
